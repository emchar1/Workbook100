Smoother pulls, wider film, and multiple advanced systems contribute to achieving your goal by providing the maximum amount of vision.    Add the revolutionary Forecast Shield for an additional layer of protection. The Forecast Shield attaches to the goggle frame over the film system to improve film retention against the lens. This improves resistance to water seepage behind the film and prevents heavier, stickier mud from peeling the film away. Add a stack of tear-offs to the integrated pins on the shield for an extra layer of confidence when the starting gate drops.
